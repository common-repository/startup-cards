== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is a ticker? =
The ticker is a unique identifier that captures the Startup’s name and the country where its headquarters are located. For example, the ticker for the Mexican Startup Clip is “CLIP:MX”. We have a search tool so that finding a ticker is easy for you.

= How many Startup Cards can I display on my website at a time with the free version? =
You can display a maximum of 10 Startup Cards at a time on the free version.

= Can I display more than one card on the same page? =
For the moment, only one Startup Card can be displayed per page. We are currently working on this feature and will notify our users when this is available.

= How do I know if the data displayed is reliable? =
We constantly work with a team of engineers that ensure the quality of the data we display.

= How frequently is our data updated? =
We try to maintain our data up-to-date and reflex this on our database. Our data gets updated dynamically and it can vary between different times. Usually, we update our data once every week. 

= How can I suggest changes or new information that I know about to be reflected on a card? =
We have a “Suggest Changes” button at the bottom of each card which will take you to a form for you to complete with the corresponding suggestions.

We are open to working with partners that can complement our data. The benefits we offer can vary. If you are interested please send an email to fran@itangelo.com.
